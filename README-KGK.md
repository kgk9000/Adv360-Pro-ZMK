======================================================================

The basic steps are as follows:

1. Go to GitHub and hit the "merge" button (or whatever it is called)
   to capture changes in Kinesis's repo, if any.

2. This will likely trigger a build; pushing changes definitely
   triggers a build.  The build creates left- and right-firmware
   files.

3. One downloads the firmware, and then for left and right, one
   double-clicks the "reset" button with a paperclip (between Detete,
   Home, and End) and drops the appropriate firmware into the disk
   drive that pops up on the desktop.

Holding the Mod-(4) key makes the LEDs display battery power (green,
yellow, orange, red?), where green is fully charged.

Turn the left side on, as it is the one that has the Bluetooth
connection to the laptop.
