kgk Notes
======================================================================

The basic steps are as follows:

1. Go to GitHub and hit the "merge" button (or whatever it is called)
   to capture changes in Kinesis's repo, if any.

2. This will likely trigger a build; pushing changes definitely
   triggers a build.  The build creates left- and right-firmware
   files.

3. Download the firmware, and then, for left and right with a USB
   connection, one double-clicks the "reset" button (between Delete,
   Home, and End) with a paperclip and drops the appropriate firmware
   into the disk drive that pops up on the desktop.  It ejects itself.

Holding the Mod-(4) key makes the LEDs display battery power (green,
yellow, orange, red?), where green is fully charged.

Turn the left side on, as it is the one that has the Bluetooth
connection to the laptop.
